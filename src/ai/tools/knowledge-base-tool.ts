/**
 * @fileOverview This file is intentionally left blank.
 * The logic for the knowledgeBaseSearchTool has been moved directly into
 * 'src/ai/flows/generate-chat-response.ts'.
 *
 * This was done to resolve a Genkit instantiation bug where the tool was defined
 * with a different AI instance than the flow that was using it, causing tool-call failures.
 * By defining the tool within the flow that uses it, we ensure both use the same
 * dynamically-configured Genkit instance.
