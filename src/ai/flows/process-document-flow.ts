// The 'processDocumentFlow' has been deprecated and replaced by the new,
// all-in-one 'indexDocument' flow. This change was made to support the
// new RAG pipeline that handles chunking and embedding generation directly
// within the application code, rather than relying on a Firebase Extension.
// All uploads and re-indexing actions now call 'indexDocument' directly.
